Space themed computer game with momentum and collision simulation.

I wrote the first verions of this game when I was an undergrad to submit to a
compeition. It was written in C++ and SDL. Recently I decided to rewrite it
in Javascript, firstly so I could learn a bit about Javascript and secondly 
so that other people could play it more easily, and maybe even contribute
eventually.

I've only really done the initial work of porting it so far, working out how
to do the drawing and get keyboard input, and doing vector and momentum logic. 
I'm not even sure it really works cross-platform as I haven't been able to 
test it properly. Let me know if you've tried it and it doesn't work!
